Objectives and Key Results: Building and implementing OKRs

In this lesson, you are learning to define and create measurable project goals and deliverables. As we continue our understanding of project management and the different tools available to help us succeed, let’s focus here on the function and benefits of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) and how to implement them across an organization.

OKRs combine a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome. 

    The objective, or goal, portion of the OKR defines what needs to be achieved. It describes a desired outcome, such as an increase in customer retention or an improvement in the employee onboarding process.
    The key results, or metric, part of the OKR defines how you will tangibly measure the success of your initiatives. It describes the standards of measurement that capture the efficacy, performance, or quality of your objective, such as amount of revenue earned or a number of units sold.  

OKRs are a common measurement tool used in organizations at the company level, team level, and even at the product or project level. OKRs are shared across the organization so that all teams have a clear understanding of the company’s goals and can align and focus their efforts to help the company reach those goals. For instance, project managers will often reference company-wide OKRs when setting their individual project OKRs in an attempt to align and bridge a connection. 

OKRs are popular because they provide a path for clear, actionable goals. There are five major benefits for OKRs, which make up the acronym FACTS:

Focus	OKRs provide focus. They help zoom in on the few important initiatives that can make an immediate, consequential difference while postponing less urgent ones.
Alignment	OKRs create transparency amongst teams, organizations, and even managers and their direct reports. OKRs are typically documented and shared with everyone for visibility.
Commitment	OKRs serve as a social contract between teams, individuals, and the organization.
Tracking	OKRs can be tracked against the commitment to gauge performance.
Stretch	OKRs provide stretch opportunities and encourage individuals to challenge themselves to achieve a larger goal.
Implementing OKRs across organizations

Since OKRs are often implemented across an organization, they help all team members see the measurable objectives and key results of a company-wide initiative. They ensure that even the most junior employees understand how their focused effort can help the company achieve its goals.  

As the project manager for a project with multiple teams and timelines but one overall goal, using OKRs can help you identify both your overarching needs and the deliverables you’ll need from each team member to fulfill the larger goals. You can use OKRs to help motivate your team since their goals can be both short- and long-term. 

Within a company, you could have OKRs on the strategic, tactical, and operational levels:

Strategic (company-level)

OKRs are usually updated on an annual basis to help drive the organization in the direction it wants to go. These high-level OKRs support the mission and objectives of the organization.  

Tactical (mid-level)

OKRs may be updated on a quarterly basis to drive team performance and help define measurable goals to help meet quarterly objectives.  

Operational (low-level)

OKRs might be set on a monthly basis to help reach objectives and manage short-term operational performance. 
Building purposeful OKRs

When you build OKRs for a project, your aim is to determine the why, the what, and the how. The why is the purpose. Why is your project significant? The what is the objective. What are you trying to accomplish? And the how is the key results. How are you going to accomplish your objective?

The why is the purpose. Why is your project significant? The what is the objective. What are you trying to accomplish? And the how is the key results. How are you going to accomplish your objective? 

When creating OKRs, you will follow these four essential steps: 

    Define your purpose. Identify the team’s mission.
    Build out your objective. What are the project’s goals?
    Develop 2–3 key results for your objective. How will you know when the objective has been met?
    Write 3–5 key initiatives that you will work towards to make progress on your OKRs.

Let’s look at an example of an OKR at the company level:

OBJECTIVE: Improve employee satisfaction

KEY RESULTS:

    Maintain an employee retention rate of 80%
    Annual employee satisfaction survey score improves by 20%
    50% of employees are actively participating in a mentorship program

Line break

In the example above, we have identified what our end goal or objective is “to improve our employee satisfaction” and then we have defined the key results that would indicate successfully meeting that goal. 

Our key initiatives for this OKR might include: 

    Launch a pilot of the mentorship program to 40 junior analysts and 20 senior managers.
    Build a feedback survey and reporting dashboard.
    Host three employee well-being sessions. 

Communicating and tracking an OKR

Since so many teams are involved in tracking OKRs, communication is key. Here are some key tips for maintaining clear communication when tracking OKRs:

    Establish the frequency with which you will check in with your team and senior managers on how your project is performing against the OKRs you set. Choose a cadence that makes sense for your team. For example, for operational OKRs with a team, you may want to check in weekly. For tactical OKRs of an area, you may want to check in biweekly or monthly. For strategic OKRs for your company, you may want to check in quarterly.
    Formalize this process. For instance, build your OKRs at the end of each quarter for the upcoming quarter. Then, execute your OKRs and score how you measured up against them at the end of that quarter. 
    Scoring your OKRs is an important part of the cycle to track and share your progress. Define how your OKRs will be scored. For example, will you use a percentage of the objective complete to determine your score? Will you score based on the completion of certain milestones? Will you use traffic lights (red, yellow, green) to score OKRs? (For example, did you clearly achieve the objective? Green. Did you fail? Red. Were you in the middle? Yellow.) From here, you can prioritize what you need to focus on in the future to improve.
