Gathering information to define scope

In this lesson, you are learning to define project scope status and differentiate in-scope, out-of-scope, and scope creep factors that affect reaching the project goal. Let’s focus here on how to identify vital elements of a project’s scope and examine the right questions to ask in order to define it. 
Asking scope-defining questions

While working in a restaurant management group, your manager calls and asks you to “update the dining space,” then quickly hangs up the phone without providing further instruction. In this initial handoff from the manager, you are missing a lot of information. How do you even know what to ask?

Let’s quickly recap the concept of scope. The scope provides an overarching framework of what is and is not included in the project statement of work and deliverables. You define the scope to help identify necessary resources, resource costs, and a schedule for the project. 

In order to get the information you need to define and document the scope, review some questions you might ask in the table below:
Table outlining what to consider when discussing scope. See detailed description for types of questions
Determining what is and is not included

Which dining space is being updated? The entire dining space? The outdoor dining space? When the manager says “update the dining space,” are they talking about new tables and chairs? Or creating a new layout for seating?

Determining the 
deliverables

Do you need to remodel the dining space with new construction? Do you need to document the dining space changes with before and after pictures?

Determining the goals

What is the end goal of this project? What is the reason for this update of the dining space? What isn’t working in the current dining space?

Determining the 
resources needed

Do you need to obtain a floor plan and building permits for dining space construction? Do you need to hire a construction firm or can you use existing employees?

Determining the budget

What is the budget for this project? Do you have enough in your budget to support the project?

Determining the 
schedule

How much time do you have to complete the project? Are there any holidays or vacations you should account for? 

Determining the 
stakeholders

How did your manager arrive at this decision to update the dining space? Did the request originate from the restaurant owner, customers, or other stakeholders?
Key takeaway

Taking the time to ask questions and ensure that you understand the scope of the project will help reduce expenses, rework, frustrations, and confusion. Make sure you understand the who, what, when, where, why, and how as it applies to the scope. If you are missing any of that information, focus your questions on those elements. Don’t be afraid to ask questions. The initiation phase of the project sets the foundation for the project, so ensuring that you understand the scope and expectations is key to success. In our restaurant management scenario, you should set up a meeting with your manager within 48 hours to discuss these details and ask your questions.
