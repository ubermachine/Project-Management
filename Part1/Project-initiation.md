## Project Initiation

The initiation phase is a crucial time for asking stakeholders the right questions, performing research, determining resources, and clearly documenting the key components of a project. Doing this will help you solidify the scope, or the boundary, of the project.

It's your responsibility as the project manager to help identify the project goals, resources, and other details based on initial discussions with the project stakeholders.

### To determine the benefits of a project,

Questions might include: What value will this project create? How much money could this project save our organization? How much money will it bring in from existing customers? How much time will be saved? How will the user experience be improved? And to determine the costs of the project, those questions might include: How much time will people have to spend on this project? What will be the one-time costs? Are there any ongoing costs? What about long-term costs? The benefits of a project should always outweigh the costs, so it's really important that you consider these questions early on.


There are several key components of initiation that you
need to consider in order
for your project to be successful:
goals, scope, deliverables,
success criteria, stakeholders, and resources.
First, you need to consider the goals of a project.
The goal is what you've been asked to
do and what you're trying to achieve.
All projects should have clear goals,
and often those will be
determined by senior company leaders with your help.
From there, you would
begin to consider the project scope.
This is the process to define
the work that needs to happen to complete the project.
You also need to consider a project's deliverables.
These are the tangible and
intangible outcomes of a project.
Once the goals, scope,
and deliverables are determined,
you need to consider success criteria.
Success criteria are the standards by which you
measure how successful a project
was in reaching its goals.
Another important consideration is your stakeholders.
Stakeholders are key to making
informed decisions at every step of the project,
including the initiation phase.
They're the people who both have an interest in and
are affected by the completion and success of a project.
As a result, they're often instrumental in
determining the goals, objectives, deliverables,
and success criteria of a project, from coming up with
the idea to outlining their expectations of its results.
As you move through the initiation phase,
it's your job to ensure that you
understand the needs of
the project stakeholders early on.
It's also your role to ensure that
all stakeholders are in agreement on
the goals and overall mission of
the project before moving on to the next phase.
Now, let's talk about resources.
Resources generally refer to the budget,
people, materials,
and other items that you'll have at your disposal.
It's super important to think
carefully about those pieces early on.
No one wants to get started on a project,
only to realize halfway through that they don't have
enough money or enough people to complete the work.
That would be a mess.
Finally, once you've established
your goals, scope, deliverables,
success criteria, stakeholders, and resources,
it's time to create a project charter.
A project charter is a document that
contains all the details of a project.
Project charters clearly define
the project and its goals,
and outline what is needed to accomplish them.
A project charter allows you to get organized,
set up a framework for what needs to be done,
and communicate those details to others.
Once you've drafted the charter,
you would then review the document with
key stakeholders to get
their approval to move into
the planning stage. 


  
 Performing a cost-benefit analysis

In the previous video, you learned that a cost-benefit analysis is the process of adding up the expected value of a project—the benefits—and comparing them to the dollar costs. In this reading, we will discuss the benefits of conducting a cost-benefit analysis, guiding questions to help you and your stakeholders conduct one, and how to calculate return on investment (ROI).
The benefits of a cost-benefit analysis

A cost-benefit analysis can minimize risks and maximize gains for projects and organizations. It can help you communicate clearly with stakeholders and executives and keep your project on track.

Because this type of analysis uses objective data, it can help reduce biases and keep stakeholder self-interest from influencing decisions. 

Comparing a project’s benefits to its costs can help you make a strong business case to stakeholders and leadership and ensure your organization pursues the most profitable or useful projects. Organizations use cost-benefit analyses to reduce waste and invest their resources responsibly.
Guiding questions for a cost-benefit analysis

When you’re pursuing a project, the benefits should outweigh the costs. It’s important for you and your stakeholders to consider questions like the ones that follow early on, while you prepare the proposal.

To determine the benefits of a project, you might ask:

    What value will this project create? 
    How much money could this project save our organization? 
    How much money will it bring in from existing customers?
    How much time will it save? 
    How will it improve the customer experience?

And to determine the costs of a project, consider questions such as:

    How much time will people have to spend on this project?
    What are the one-time costs?
    Are there any ongoing costs?
    What about long term-costs? 

You might also consider questions about intangible benefits. These are gains that are not quantifiable, such as:

    Customer satisfaction. Will the project increase customer retention, causing them to spend more on the company’s products or services? 
    Employee satisfaction. Is the project likely to improve employee morale, reducing turnover? 
    Employee productivity. Will the project reduce employee’s overtime hours, saving the company money?
    Brand perception. Is the project likely to improve the company’s brand perception and recognition, attracting more customers or providing a competitive advantage?

You can also flip these questions to consider intangible costs. These are costs that are unquantifiable. For example, might the project put customer retention, employee satisfaction, or brand perception at risk?

When assigning values to tangible or intangible costs and benefits, you can reference similar past projects, conduct industry research, or consult with experts.
Calculating costs and benefits

The process of calculating costs and benefits is also called calculating return on investment, or ROI. There are many ways to determine a project’s ROI, but the easiest way is to compare the upfront and ongoing costs to its benefits over time.

One common ROI formula is:(g-c)/c=ROI

In this formula, G represents the financial gains you expect from the project, and C represents the upfront and ongoing costs of your investment in the project.

For example, imagine your project costs $6,000 up front plus $25 per month for 12 months. This equals $300 per year, but you estimate that the project will bring in $10,000 in revenue over the course of that year. Using the formula above, you calculate the ROI as: ($10,000 - $6,300) ÷ $6,300 = 0.58 = 58%

The ROI comes to 0.58, or 58%. You consider this to be a strong ROI, so you decide to pursue the project.

  
  
# SMART goals: Making goals meaningful

In this lesson you are learning to define and create measurable project goals and deliverables. Now, let's focus on SMART goals.

Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART) goals are very helpful for ensuring project success. As you start your career in project management, you may not directly set the project goals, but you should be able to clarify and understand them. SMART goals help you see the full scope of a goal, determine its feasibility, and clearly define project success in concrete terms. 

Let’s recap what we discussed in the previous video by taking a look at a breakdown of the criteria for SMART goals below: 

Six Icons for SMART goals: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound

    Specific: The objective has no ambiguity for the project team to misinterpret. 
    Measurable: Metrics help the project team determine when the objective is met.
    Attainable: The project team agrees the objective is realistic.
    Relevant: The goal fits the organization’s strategic plan and supports the project charter.
    Time-bound: The project team documents a date to achieve the goal.

Focusing on the "M" in SMART

Let’s take a moment to zoom in on the M in SMART, which stands for measurable. Having measurable goals allows you to assess the success of your project based on quantifiable or tangible metrics, such as dollar amounts, number of outputs, quantities, etc. Measurable goals are important because they leave little room for confusion around expectations from stakeholders. 

Not every metric will have value, so you will have to determine which metrics make sense for the project. For example, measuring how many meetings the engineers on your project attend on a weekly basis may not be the most valuable metric for a productivity goal. Alternatively, you might measure other aspects of the engineers’ productivity, such as a particular number of features created per engineer or a specific number of issues flagged per day.
Defining a SMART goal

Let’s explore an example related to making a personal goal measurable. Imagine you are looking to make a career change, and you set a goal to complete a Google Career Certificate. You can measure the success of this goal because after completing the entire program, you will receive a certificate—a tangible outcome.

Now, let’s determine how to make the remaining elements of this goal SMART. In this example, your specific goal is to attain a Google Career Certificate. You can make this goal attainable by deciding that you will complete one course per month. This goal is relevant because it supports your desire to make a career change. Finally, you can make this goal time-bound by deciding that you will complete the program within six months.

After defining each of these components, your SMART goal then becomes: Obtain a Google Career Certificate by taking one course per month within the next six months.
