## Project Initiation

The initiation phase is a crucial time for asking stakeholders the right questions, performing research, determining resources, and clearly documenting the key components of a project. Doing this will help you solidify the scope, or the boundary, of the project.

It's your responsibility as the project manager to help identify the project goals, resources, and other details based on initial discussions with the project stakeholders.

### To determine the benefits of a project,

Questions might include: What value will this project create? How much money could this project save our organization? How much money will it bring in from existing customers? How much time will be saved? How will the user experience be improved? And to determine the costs of the project, those questions might include: How much time will people have to spend on this project? What will be the one-time costs? Are there any ongoing costs? What about long-term costs? The benefits of a project should always outweigh the costs, so it's really important that you consider these questions early on.


There are several key components of initiation that you
need to consider in order
for your project to be successful:
goals, scope, deliverables,
success criteria, stakeholders, and resources.
First, you need to consider the goals of a project.
The goal is what you've been asked to
do and what you're trying to achieve.
All projects should have clear goals,
and often those will be
determined by senior company leaders with your help.
From there, you would
begin to consider the project scope.
This is the process to define
the work that needs to happen to complete the project.
You also need to consider a project's deliverables.
These are the tangible and
intangible outcomes of a project.
Once the goals, scope,
and deliverables are determined,
you need to consider success criteria.
Success criteria are the standards by which you
measure how successful a project
was in reaching its goals.
Another important consideration is your stakeholders.
Stakeholders are key to making
informed decisions at every step of the project,
including the initiation phase.
They're the people who both have an interest in and
are affected by the completion and success of a project.
As a result, they're often instrumental in
determining the goals, objectives, deliverables,
and success criteria of a project, from coming up with
the idea to outlining their expectations of its results.
As you move through the initiation phase,
it's your job to ensure that you
understand the needs of
the project stakeholders early on.
It's also your role to ensure that
all stakeholders are in agreement on
the goals and overall mission of
the project before moving on to the next phase.
Now, let's talk about resources.
Resources generally refer to the budget,
people, materials,
and other items that you'll have at your disposal.
It's super important to think
carefully about those pieces early on.
No one wants to get started on a project,
only to realize halfway through that they don't have
enough money or enough people to complete the work.
That would be a mess.
Finally, once you've established
your goals, scope, deliverables,
success criteria, stakeholders, and resources,
it's time to create a project charter.
A project charter is a document that
contains all the details of a project.
Project charters clearly define
the project and its goals,
and outline what is needed to accomplish them.
A project charter allows you to get organized,
set up a framework for what needs to be done,
and communicate those details to others.
Once you've drafted the charter,
you would then review the document with
key stakeholders to get
their approval to move into
the planning stage.
