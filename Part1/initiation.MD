# Project Initiation

The initiation phase is a crucial time for asking stakeholders the right questions,
performing research, determining resources, and
clearly documenting the key components of a project.
Doing this will help you solidify the scope, or the boundary, of the project.

It's your responsibility as the project manager to help identify the project goals,
resources, and other details based on initial discussions with the project
stakeholders.

### To determine the benefits of a project,
Questions might include:
What value will this project create?
How much money could this project save our organization?
How much money will it bring in from existing customers?
How much time will be saved?
How will the user experience be improved? And to determine the costs of the project,
those questions might include:
How much time will people have to spend on this project?
What will be the one-time costs?
Are there any ongoing costs?
What about long-term costs?
The benefits of a project should always outweigh the costs,
so it's really important that you consider these questions early on.
