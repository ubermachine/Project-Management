# Project-Management
## Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to meet the project requirements and achieve the desired outcome.
  
A project, is a unique endeavor,
and usually includes a set of unique deliverables.
It's also a temporary pursuit.
It has a defined beginning and an end.
To put it another way, a project is a series of tasks
that need to be completed
to reach a desired outcome. 
  
Project managers usually follow a process that involves planning and organizing,
managing tasks, budgeting, controlling costs and other factors.
Everything they do helps make sure the project can be completed on time and
on budget.
In broad terms, a project manager also needs to make sure that
the project outcome is bringing value to the company.
  
Some common project management-related buzzwords and skills you could include on your resume and while searching jobs are:

    Analytical
    Assertive
    Assessing outcomes
    Assessing progress
    Attention to detail

# Responsibilities
  
Teaching and mentoring

As a project manager, you can serve as a mentor to your team. When you take the time to fully explain the expectations, you eliminate rework, confusion, and frustration. Mentoring and teaching others the lessons that you, as a project manager, have learned allows your team to make better choices and build on your experience. Mentoring also involves supporting each individual on your team in meeting expectations and helping them to exceed their own sense of personal potential.
Building relationships 

Relationships are everything! Getting to know your team members lets them know that you care about them as people, not just employees. Taking the time to build relationships with your customers, clients, vendors, and other stakeholders is equally important. Dedicate time to checking in with people. Pay attention to the insights they offer you about their work style since their actions can inform how to most effectively interact with them. Ask about their lives beyond the project, and then follow up on those discussions later on to show your interest. When you foster these relationships, you are all more invested in the success of your project.
  
Controlling change

The American novelist Louis L’Amour wrote, “The only thing that never changes is that everything changes.” This applies to projects as well. Projects change as you continue to understand the expectations and the needs of our stakeholders. As a project manager, you need to remain flexible and adjust to the stakeholders’ needs. However, it is also important to protect your team from constant change and rework. A good way to do this is by documenting the initial expectations of the project and clearly identifying the changes being requested. It is also helpful to understand the budget and schedule impact of the changes and make sure that the stakeholders understand those impacts. As the project manager, you are responsible for protecting your team. 

Empowering your team

We all enjoy being heard and appreciated in our careers. Giving your team the ability to work directly with the stakeholders and their teams lets them know that you trust and believe in their skills! One of the best things about empowering your team is getting fresh ideas and passionate employees willing to help find solutions to problems. Another way you can empower your team is by delegating responsibilities to them, allowing them to make some decisions for the project, and using their input in the planning and execution of the project. Effective mentoring often leads to more empowered teams.
  
Communicating status and concerns

As a project manager, communication is everything. With effective communication, you can work together with your team to find solutions to challenges. The project manager sets the tone for the project. Maintaining an open door policy and building trust within your team and among stakeholders—all while staying positive—will help the success of the project.


# Working with cross-functional teams  
Clarify goals

When working with cross-functional teams, it is important to ensure that each member of the team understands their role, how they support each other, and the common goals of the project. It is vital to set clear goals for the team and make sure that the team understands those goals. Be direct and concise, avoiding extraneous details and explanations. When communicating task or project goals, make sure you define key items, such as budget, deadlines, quality requirements, or important resources. Ensure your team members understand task and project goals by encouraging them to ask questions and clarify information. It will be up to you to continuously check in with your team to make sure they’re all moving towards their goals, staying on track, and completing quality work. Cross-functional teams may work in different departments, be in different physical locations, and have different leadership, but all team members work together with the project manager to support the current project. Your project may be competing against other priorities, so communicating clearly and often with your team—and vice versa—helps you identify any potential issues or concerns before they arise.   
Get team members with the right skills

Making sure you have team members with the correct skill sets for each of the project functions is critical. If you are building an airplane and you’ve got five engineers but no mechanics, you are missing a key element of your cross-functional team. As the project manager, you must help ensure that your team has the right people with the right skill sets needed for the project to succeed. Later in this program, we will discuss some tools you can use to help you identify the skill sets needed to accomplish your project tasks.  
Measure progress

Showing your team how much they have accomplished helps keep them motivated. Take the time to measure and communicate the project’s progress across the cross-functional team. This helps everyone see the full picture and recognize their impact on the project. You can measure progress in many ways, including meeting key milestones, completing project tasks, and meeting project goals on time and within budget. Regularly communicate with your team members to check on their progress. Ask them if they anticipate being finished on time. If not, ask how you can help them succeed. Keep track of the team’s progress throughout the project by documenting when tasks and goals are completed, and let your team members know if the project is on track or not. Make sure you communicate successes, delays, or issues, to the team so they know how the project is progressing. Keeping everyone informed is essential to the project’s success.  
Recognize efforts

Sometimes, when you work with cross-functional teams, there are certain skills that get recognized more than others. A mechanic could get accolades for coming up with the solution to a problem within the project, while the finance member who sourced the funding might be forgotten. As a project manager, it is your job to make sure that each member of your cross-functional team recognizes the value of their efforts each step of the way. You have learned the importance of building relationships with stakeholders, and building relationships with your cross-functional team members is just as important. Learning what makes your team members feel supported, giving and taking feedback, and being mindful of each individual's background, personal identifiers, and work style can help mediate some of the differences among team members. 

# Core skills  
Enabling decision-making,
communicating and escalating, flexibility,
and strong organizational skills. 

# Interpersonal skills 
communication, negotiation,
conflict mediation and understanding motivations are
all interpersonal skills that will
help you influence without authority. 

  
# Project lifecycle  
The main phases of a project are initiate the project,
make a plan, execute
and complete tasks, and finally, close the project. 

  
The project life cycle
Initiate the project

In this phase, ask questions to help set the foundation for the project, such as:

    Who are the stakeholders?
    What are the client’s or customer’s goals?
    What is the purpose and mission of the project?
    What are the measurable objectives for the team?
    What is the project trying to improve? 
    When does this project need to be completed? 
    What skills and resources will the project require? 
    What will the project cost? What are the benefits?

Make a plan

In this phase, make a plan to get your project from start to finish. 

    Create a detailed project plan. What are the major milestones? What tasks or deliverables make up each milestone?  
    Build out the schedule so you can properly manage the resources, budget, materials, and timeline. Here, you will create an itemized budget.

Execute the project

In this phase, put all of your hard work from the first two phases into action. 

    Monitor your project team as they complete project tasks. 
    Break down any barriers that would slow or stop the team from completing tasks. 
    Help keep the team aware of schedule and deliverable expectations.
    Address weaknesses in your process or examine places where your team may need additional training to meet the project’s goals.
    Adapt to changes in the project as they arise.

Close the project

In this phase, close out the project.

    Identify that your team has completed all of the requested outcomes. 
    Release your team so they can support other projects within the company.
    Take time with your team to celebrate your successes! 
    Pass off all remaining deliverables and get stakeholder approval.
    Document the lessons you and your team learned during the project.
    Reflect on ways to improve in the future.

  
# Project management methodology
A project management methodology is a set of guiding principles and
processes for owning a project through its life cycle.
Project management methodologies
help guide project managers throughout a project with steps to take,
tasks to complete, and principles for managing the project overall. 


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53916068/115158571-7274ac00-a0ac-11eb-9c94-8594f85902b1.png)

Lean

Lean methodology is often referred to as Lean Manufacturing because it originated in the manufacturing world. The main principle in Lean methodology is the removal of waste within an operation. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, only value is added at each phase of production.  

Today, the Lean Manufacturing methodology recognizes eight types of waste within an operation: defects, excess processing, overproduction, waiting, inventory, transportation, motion, and non-utilized talent. In the manufacturing industry, these types of waste are often attributed to issues such as: 

    Lack of proper documentation
    Lack of process standards
    Not understanding the customers’ needs
    Lack of effective communication
    Lack of process control
    Inefficient process design
    Failures of management

These same issues create waste in project management. 

Implement Lean project management when you want to use limited resources, reduce waste, and streamline processes to gain maximum benefits. 

You can achieve this by using the pillars of the Lean 5S quality tool. The term 5S refers to the five pillars that are required for good housekeeping: sort, set in order, shine, standardize, and sustain. Implementing the 5S method means cleaning up and organizing the workplace to achieve the smallest amount of wasted time and material. The 5S method includes these five steps: 

    Sort: Remove all items not needed for current production operations and leave only the bare essentials. 
    Set in order: Arrange needed items so that they are easy to use. Label items so that anyone can find them or put them away. 
    Shine: Keep everything in the correct place. Clean your workspace every day.
    Standardize: Perform the process in the same way every time. 
    Sustain: Make a habit of maintaining correct procedures and instill this discipline in your team.

Within the Lean methodology, 5S helps you boost performance. 

The final concept of Lean uses a Kanban scheduling system to manage production. The Kanban scheduling system, or Kanban board, is a visualization tool that enables you to optimize the flow of your team’s work. It gives the team a visual display to identify what needs to be done and when. The Kanban board uses cards that are moved from left to right to show progress and help your team coordinate the work. 
Kanban board, showing columns (to do, in progress, testing, and done) with sticky notes representing tasks of a project.

Kanban boards and 5S are core principles of the Lean methodology. They can help you successfully manage your project. Now let’s analyze the Six Sigma method and learn when is the best time to use it. 
Six Sigma

Six Sigma is a methodology used to reduce variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time. The term “Six Sigma” originates from statistics and generally means that items or processes should have 99.9996% quality.

The seven key principles of Six Sigma are:

    Always focus on the customer.
    Identify and understand how the work gets done. Understand how work really happens.
    Make your processes flow smoothly.
    Reduce waste and concentrate on value.
    Stop defects by removing variation.
    Involve and collaborate with your team.
    Approach improvement activity in a systematic way.

Use this methodology to find aspects of the product or process that are measurable like time, cost, or quantity. Then inspect that measurable item and reject any products that do not meet the Six Sigma standard. Any process that created unacceptable products has to be improved upon.  
  
  
## Popular project management approaches

Below is a brief recap of some of the project management approaches you’ve been introduced to so far:

Waterfall is a traditional methodology in which tasks and phases are completed in a linear, sequential manner, and each stage of the project must be completed before the next begins. The project manager is responsible for prioritizing and assigning tasks to team members. In Waterfall, the criteria used to measure quality is clearly defined at the beginning of the project.

Agile involves short phases of collaborative, iterative work with frequent testing and regularly-implemented improvements. Some phases and tasks happen at the same time as others. In Agile projects, teams share responsibility for managing their own work. Scrum and Kanban are examples of Agile frameworks, which are specific development approaches based on the Agile philosophy.

Scrum focuses on developing, delivering, and sustaining complex project and products through collaboration, accountability, and an iterative process. Like many Agile frameworks, work is often completed by smaller, cross-functional teams and divided into short “Sprints” with a set list of deliverables.

Kanban is both an approach and a tool that provides visual feedback about the status of the work in progress through the use of Kanban boards or charts. With Kanban, project managers use sticky notes or note cards on a physical or digital Kanban board to represent the team’s tasks with categories like “To do,” “In progress,” and “Done.”

Lean focuses on efficiency, applying core principles to maximize value and minimize waste. Lean’s principles state that you can do more with less by addressing dysfunctions that create waste.

Six Sigma involves reducing variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time. The Six Sigma method follows a process-improvement approach called DMAIC, which stands for define, measure, analyze, improve, and control.

Lean Six Sigma is a combination of Lean and Six Sigma approaches. It uses the 5S quality tool to eliminate eight areas of waste, save money, improve quality, and streamline processes. Lean Six Sigma uses Kanban boards to manage production and is ideal for solving complex or high-risk problems.

# What are the functions of a PMO?

PMOs offer guidance and support to their organization’s project managers. They share best practices, project statuses, and direction for all of the organization’s projects while often taking on strategic projects themselves. The main functions of a PMO include:
Strategic planning and governance

This is the most important function of a PMO. This involves defining project criteria, selecting projects according to the organization’s business goals, and then providing a business case for those projects to management. 
Best practices

PMOs help implement best practices and processes within their organization. They also share lessons learned from previous successful projects. They help ensure consistency among their organization’s projects by providing guidance about processes, tools, and metrics.
Common project culture 

PMOs help set common project culture practices by training employees about optimal approaches and best practices. This helps keep project management practices consistent and efficient across the entire organization. 
Resource management

PMOs are often responsible for managing and allocating resources—such as people and equipment—across projects throughout the organization based on budget, priorities, schedules, and more. They also help define the roles and responsibilities needed on any given project. PMOs provide training, mentoring, and coaching to all employees, but project managers in particular. 
Creation of project documentation, archives, and tools

PMOs invest in and provide templates, tools, and software to help manage projects. They also play an important role in maintaining their organization’s project history. Once a project closes, they archive all of the documents created during the project for future reference and to capture lessons learned. 


  
  # The importance of organizational culture 

    Identity: An organization’s culture defines its identity. Its identity essentially describes the way the company conducts  business, both internally and externally. A company’s values and organizational culture go hand-in-hand; its values are part of its identity. You can almost think of an organization’s culture as its personality. That is why it is important to learn your company’s (or target company’s) mission and value statements. The mission and value statements will help you understand why the company exists and will give you insight into what the company believes in and how it will behave. 
    People: Strong, positive organizational culture helps retain a company’s best employees. People who feel valued, engaged, and challenged are more likely to give their best and want to drive for success. An organization’s culture can help keep talented employees at a company, and it can attract great people too! On the other hand, a toxic culture can have the opposite effect. It is important to find an organization with a culture that fits your personality. One way to find out more about an organization's culture is to talk to the people who work there. You can also take note of the current employees’ attire, expressions, and overall behavior.
    Processes: Organizational culture can have direct impacts on a company's processes, and ultimately, its productivity. The organization’s culture is instilled throughout the company—from its employees to how its employees do their job. For example, a company that values feedback and employee involvement might have that reflected in their processes by including many opportunities for employees to comment. By allowing employees to feel their voices are heard, this company is adhering to its culture. 

Understanding an organization’s culture

As a project manager, it is important to understand your company’s culture, especially because it could affect the projects you work on. Some aspects of an organization’s culture that are directly related to how you will manage projects are communication, decision-making, rituals, previous management styles, and values. To learn more about a company’s culture and how it applies to you as a project manager, you can: 
Ask questions

You can learn about an organization's culture by asking questions of management and peers. It can be helpful to ask these questions in the interview phase to better understand the company’s culture before accepting a position. You might want to ask questions about:
Atmosphere

    What is the company’s dress code? 
    How do people typically share credit at this company? 
    Is risk-taking encouraged, and what happens when people fail?
    How do managers support and motivate their team?
    How do people in this role interact with customers and users?
    When and how do team members give feedback to one another?
    What are some workplace traditions?
    What are some of the ways the company celebrates success?

Policies

    What are the policies around sick days and vacation?
    Does the company allow for employee flexibility (e.g., working from home, flexible working hours)?
    What policies are in place that support employees sharing their identity in the workplace?

Processes

    What is the company’s onboarding process?
    How do employees measure the impact of their work?

Values

    What are the company’s mission and value statements?
    How might the person in this role contribute to the organization’s mission?
    How does the organization support professional development and career growth?

Listen to people’s stories

Listening to what current employees have to say and how they portray the company will give you great insight.

    What were employees' experiences with similar projects in the past? 
    What can they tell you about key stakeholders and customers? 

Take note of company rituals

Rituals can be powerful drivers of culture. They engage people and help instill a sense of shared purpose and experience. 

    How are birthdays and holidays celebrated? 
    Do employees generally eat lunch at the same time and in the same place? 
    Watch employee interactions: Observing how employees interact can help you tailor your interaction style to the company norm. 
    Are employee interactions more formal or informal in nature? 
    Are ideas solicited from employees in different roles? 

Understand your impact

As a project manager, you become a change agent. Remember: a change agent is a person from inside an organization who helps the organization transform by focusing on improving organizational effectiveness and development. When you begin a new role, sit down with management to better understand what is expected of you and how you can make the most of the opportunity.
Sharpen your communication skills

Interpersonal communication skills are a major part of project management. How a company communicates is directly tied to its organizational culture. You will most likely have interactions with various departments and management levels while executing projects. To communicate effectively, you will need to understand how to navigate the different channels in your company. Ask questions about communication practices when you start a new role such as: Is it customary to sign emails from the team rather than from you individually? Should presentations include team members or be solely presented by the project manager? This can help you make sure you are adhering to expectations.

Approaching projects differently from how similar projects were managed in the past may be met with some resistance. Although some projects may call for you to break the status quo, when you show an appreciation of your organization’s culture, you may help your team members accept any improvements you are implementing.


# Integrating project management and change management

As a project manager, you can think of change management as necessary for the successful outcome of your project. Both change management and project management aim to increase the likelihood of project success and incorporate tools and processes to accomplish that goal. The most effective way to achieve a project goal is to integrate project management and change management, and it is your responsibility as a project manager to do so. Let’s look at a few ways you can approach change management on your projects:

    Be proactive: Incorporate change management into your project management steps. For example, you can schedule documentation reviews periodically to ensure that your team members know there is a place to voice their suggestions and concerns. You can also plan steps towards the end of your project to introduce the deliverable to users in the form of demonstrations, question and answer forums, or marketing videos. You can factor all of these decisions into your plan so that any potential changes are less likely to impact your timeline. If these steps have not been built into your plan, you can escalate and stress the importance of a change management plan to your stakeholders. Proactive and inclusive change management planning can help keep any potentially impacted stakeholders aware of the upcoming changes.
    Communicate: Maintaining communication about upcoming changes are vital to ensuring successful change management. Communication should occur regularly among impacted stakeholders, the change management team, and the project team. 

    Follow a consistent process: Following a clear change management process helps maintain consistency each time there is a change. The change management process should be established and documented early on in your project to guide how the project will handle change. Your organization may also have an overarching change management plan that can be adopted for your project. This may include when the promotion of the change should happen, when training should occur, when the launch or release will occur, and corresponding steps for each phase of the process. 

    Use tools: Incorporating tools to assist in the adoption of a change can be very helpful. Let's examine a few examples you can use on your next project. Feedback mechanisms, such as surveys, can capture input from stakeholders. Flowcharts can visualize the project's development process. Culture mapping can illustrate the company's culture and how the company's values, norms, and employees behavior may be affected by the change.


# Corporate and project governance

Governance in business is the management framework within which decisions are made and accountability and responsibility are determined. In simple terms, governance is understanding who is in charge. In this reading, we will discuss corporate governance and project governance. It is important to learn how corporate and project governance are related since you may have to speak about governance in an interview. Additionally, you will need to understand how your project relates to the governance structure of the organization.
Corporate governance

Each organization is governed by its own set of standards and practices that direct and control its actions. Those standards and practices are called corporate governance, and they will influence your projects. Corporate governance is the framework by which an organization achieves its goals and objectives. Corporate governance is also a way to balance the requirements of the various corporate entities, such as stakeholders, management, and customers. Corporate governance affects every part of an organization, including action plans, internal and external controls, and performance measurements.

Governance and change management go hand-in-hand. Think back to the previous videos on change management. To successfully implement change management, it is essential that you understand the structure and culture of the organization. Effective governance in change management provides clearly defined roles and responsibilities during change. This enables the people within the organization to have a precise understanding of who makes decisions and of the relationship between those managing and participating in the change management process. 

Another example of governance within an organization is the creation and use of steering committees. Steering committees decide on the priorities of an organization and manage the general course of its operations. The steering committee essentially acts as an advisory board or council to help the project manager and the company make and approve strategic decisions that affect both the company and the project. 
Project governance

As a project manager, you will be responsible for project governance. Project governance is the framework for how project decisions are made. Project governance helps keep projects running smoothly, on time, and within budget. Project governance involves all the key elements that make a project successful. It tells you what activities an organization does and who is responsible for those activities. Project governance covers policies, regulations, functions, processes, procedures, and responsibilities. 
How project and corporate governance intersect

Project governance needs to be tailored to your organization's specific needs. These needs will influence how you implement and monitor the governance framework on your project. Project governance concerns those areas of corporate governance that are specifically related to project activities. Effective project governance ensures that an organization’s projects are aligned to the organization’s larger objectives, are delivered efficiently, and are sustainable. This includes:

    Considering the long- and short-term interests of your organization
    Making thoughtful decisions about which projects to take on and avoiding projects if you do not have sufficient resources
    Providing timely, relevant, and reliable information to the board of directors and other major stakeholders 

    Eliciting the input and buy-in of senior managers since they are the decision-makers 
    During the initiation phase, prioritizing clear, reachable, and sustainable goals in order to reduce confusion and conflict
    During the planning phase, assigning ownership and accountability to an experienced team to deliver, monitor, and control the process 
    During the execution phase, learning from mistakes and adapting to new or improved knowledge

Corporate governance can involve clearing many hurdles before making decisions. These decisions can influence not only a single project, but the entire corporation. 

At the same time, corporate governance can help support project governance, as it provides oversight on compliance and mitigating risk and offers guidance and direction for project managers. Good corporate governance can also help project managers secure resources, get issues addressed, avoid delays in decision-making, get buy-in from stakeholders, and achieve visibility for projects on the executive level.
