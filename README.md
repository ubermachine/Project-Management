# Project-Management
## Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to meet the project requirements and achieve the desired outcome.

A project, is a unique endeavor,
and usually includes a set of unique deliverables.
It's also a temporary pursuit.
It has a defined beginning and an end.
To put it another way, a project is a series of tasks
that need to be completed
to reach a desired outcome. 

Project managers usually follow a process that involves planning and organizing,
managing tasks, budgeting, controlling costs and other factors.
Everything they do helps make sure the project can be completed on time and
on budget.
