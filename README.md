# Project-Management
## Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to meet the project requirements and achieve the desired outcome.
  
A project, is a unique endeavor,
and usually includes a set of unique deliverables.
It's also a temporary pursuit.
It has a defined beginning and an end.
To put it another way, a project is a series of tasks
that need to be completed
to reach a desired outcome. 
  
Project managers usually follow a process that involves planning and organizing,
managing tasks, budgeting, controlling costs and other factors.
Everything they do helps make sure the project can be completed on time and
on budget.
In broad terms, a project manager also needs to make sure that
the project outcome is bringing value to the company.

# Responsibilities
  
Teaching and mentoring

As a project manager, you can serve as a mentor to your team. When you take the time to fully explain the expectations, you eliminate rework, confusion, and frustration. Mentoring and teaching others the lessons that you, as a project manager, have learned allows your team to make better choices and build on your experience. Mentoring also involves supporting each individual on your team in meeting expectations and helping them to exceed their own sense of personal potential.
Building relationships 

Relationships are everything! Getting to know your team members lets them know that you care about them as people, not just employees. Taking the time to build relationships with your customers, clients, vendors, and other stakeholders is equally important. Dedicate time to checking in with people. Pay attention to the insights they offer you about their work style since their actions can inform how to most effectively interact with them. Ask about their lives beyond the project, and then follow up on those discussions later on to show your interest. When you foster these relationships, you are all more invested in the success of your project.
  
Controlling change

The American novelist Louis L’Amour wrote, “The only thing that never changes is that everything changes.” This applies to projects as well. Projects change as you continue to understand the expectations and the needs of our stakeholders. As a project manager, you need to remain flexible and adjust to the stakeholders’ needs. However, it is also important to protect your team from constant change and rework. A good way to do this is by documenting the initial expectations of the project and clearly identifying the changes being requested. It is also helpful to understand the budget and schedule impact of the changes and make sure that the stakeholders understand those impacts. As the project manager, you are responsible for protecting your team. 

Empowering your team

We all enjoy being heard and appreciated in our careers. Giving your team the ability to work directly with the stakeholders and their teams lets them know that you trust and believe in their skills! One of the best things about empowering your team is getting fresh ideas and passionate employees willing to help find solutions to problems. Another way you can empower your team is by delegating responsibilities to them, allowing them to make some decisions for the project, and using their input in the planning and execution of the project. Effective mentoring often leads to more empowered teams.
  
Communicating status and concerns

As a project manager, communication is everything. With effective communication, you can work together with your team to find solutions to challenges. The project manager sets the tone for the project. Maintaining an open door policy and building trust within your team and among stakeholders—all while staying positive—will help the success of the project.


# Working with cross-functional teams  
Clarify goals

When working with cross-functional teams, it is important to ensure that each member of the team understands their role, how they support each other, and the common goals of the project. It is vital to set clear goals for the team and make sure that the team understands those goals. Be direct and concise, avoiding extraneous details and explanations. When communicating task or project goals, make sure you define key items, such as budget, deadlines, quality requirements, or important resources. Ensure your team members understand task and project goals by encouraging them to ask questions and clarify information. It will be up to you to continuously check in with your team to make sure they’re all moving towards their goals, staying on track, and completing quality work. Cross-functional teams may work in different departments, be in different physical locations, and have different leadership, but all team members work together with the project manager to support the current project. Your project may be competing against other priorities, so communicating clearly and often with your team—and vice versa—helps you identify any potential issues or concerns before they arise.   
Get team members with the right skills

Making sure you have team members with the correct skill sets for each of the project functions is critical. If you are building an airplane and you’ve got five engineers but no mechanics, you are missing a key element of your cross-functional team. As the project manager, you must help ensure that your team has the right people with the right skill sets needed for the project to succeed. Later in this program, we will discuss some tools you can use to help you identify the skill sets needed to accomplish your project tasks.  
Measure progress

Showing your team how much they have accomplished helps keep them motivated. Take the time to measure and communicate the project’s progress across the cross-functional team. This helps everyone see the full picture and recognize their impact on the project. You can measure progress in many ways, including meeting key milestones, completing project tasks, and meeting project goals on time and within budget. Regularly communicate with your team members to check on their progress. Ask them if they anticipate being finished on time. If not, ask how you can help them succeed. Keep track of the team’s progress throughout the project by documenting when tasks and goals are completed, and let your team members know if the project is on track or not. Make sure you communicate successes, delays, or issues, to the team so they know how the project is progressing. Keeping everyone informed is essential to the project’s success.  
Recognize efforts

Sometimes, when you work with cross-functional teams, there are certain skills that get recognized more than others. A mechanic could get accolades for coming up with the solution to a problem within the project, while the finance member who sourced the funding might be forgotten. As a project manager, it is your job to make sure that each member of your cross-functional team recognizes the value of their efforts each step of the way. You have learned the importance of building relationships with stakeholders, and building relationships with your cross-functional team members is just as important. Learning what makes your team members feel supported, giving and taking feedback, and being mindful of each individual's background, personal identifiers, and work style can help mediate some of the differences among team members. 

# Core skills  
Enabling decision-making,
communicating and escalating, flexibility,
and strong organizational skills. 

# Interpersonal skills 
communication, negotiation,
conflict mediation and understanding motivations are
all interpersonal skills that will
help you influence without authority. 

  
# Project lifecycle  
The main phases of a project are initiate the project,
make a plan, execute
and complete tasks, and finally, close the project. 

  
The project life cycle
Initiate the project

In this phase, ask questions to help set the foundation for the project, such as:

    Who are the stakeholders?
    What are the client’s or customer’s goals?
    What is the purpose and mission of the project?
    What are the measurable objectives for the team?
    What is the project trying to improve? 
    When does this project need to be completed? 
    What skills and resources will the project require? 
    What will the project cost? What are the benefits?

Make a plan

In this phase, make a plan to get your project from start to finish. 

    Create a detailed project plan. What are the major milestones? What tasks or deliverables make up each milestone?  
    Build out the schedule so you can properly manage the resources, budget, materials, and timeline. Here, you will create an itemized budget.

Execute the project

In this phase, put all of your hard work from the first two phases into action. 

    Monitor your project team as they complete project tasks. 
    Break down any barriers that would slow or stop the team from completing tasks. 
    Help keep the team aware of schedule and deliverable expectations.
    Address weaknesses in your process or examine places where your team may need additional training to meet the project’s goals.
    Adapt to changes in the project as they arise.

Close the project

In this phase, close out the project.

    Identify that your team has completed all of the requested outcomes. 
    Release your team so they can support other projects within the company.
    Take time with your team to celebrate your successes! 
    Pass off all remaining deliverables and get stakeholder approval.
    Document the lessons you and your team learned during the project.
    Reflect on ways to improve in the future.
