# Project-Management
## Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to meet the project requirements and achieve the desired outcome.
  
A project, is a unique endeavor,
and usually includes a set of unique deliverables.
It's also a temporary pursuit.
It has a defined beginning and an end.
To put it another way, a project is a series of tasks
that need to be completed
to reach a desired outcome. 
  
Project managers usually follow a process that involves planning and organizing,
managing tasks, budgeting, controlling costs and other factors.
Everything they do helps make sure the project can be completed on time and
on budget.
In broad terms, a project manager also needs to make sure that
the project outcome is bringing value to the company.

# Responsibilities
  
Teaching and mentoring

As a project manager, you can serve as a mentor to your team. When you take the time to fully explain the expectations, you eliminate rework, confusion, and frustration. Mentoring and teaching others the lessons that you, as a project manager, have learned allows your team to make better choices and build on your experience. Mentoring also involves supporting each individual on your team in meeting expectations and helping them to exceed their own sense of personal potential.
Building relationships 

Relationships are everything! Getting to know your team members lets them know that you care about them as people, not just employees. Taking the time to build relationships with your customers, clients, vendors, and other stakeholders is equally important. Dedicate time to checking in with people. Pay attention to the insights they offer you about their work style since their actions can inform how to most effectively interact with them. Ask about their lives beyond the project, and then follow up on those discussions later on to show your interest. When you foster these relationships, you are all more invested in the success of your project.
  
Controlling change

The American novelist Louis L’Amour wrote, “The only thing that never changes is that everything changes.” This applies to projects as well. Projects change as you continue to understand the expectations and the needs of our stakeholders. As a project manager, you need to remain flexible and adjust to the stakeholders’ needs. However, it is also important to protect your team from constant change and rework. A good way to do this is by documenting the initial expectations of the project and clearly identifying the changes being requested. It is also helpful to understand the budget and schedule impact of the changes and make sure that the stakeholders understand those impacts. As the project manager, you are responsible for protecting your team. 

Empowering your team

We all enjoy being heard and appreciated in our careers. Giving your team the ability to work directly with the stakeholders and their teams lets them know that you trust and believe in their skills! One of the best things about empowering your team is getting fresh ideas and passionate employees willing to help find solutions to problems. Another way you can empower your team is by delegating responsibilities to them, allowing them to make some decisions for the project, and using their input in the planning and execution of the project. Effective mentoring often leads to more empowered teams.
  
Communicating status and concerns

As a project manager, communication is everything. With effective communication, you can work together with your team to find solutions to challenges. The project manager sets the tone for the project. Maintaining an open door policy and building trust within your team and among stakeholders—all while staying positive—will help the success of the project.


# Working with cross-functional teams  
Clarify goals

When working with cross-functional teams, it is important to ensure that each member of the team understands their role, how they support each other, and the common goals of the project. It is vital to set clear goals for the team and make sure that the team understands those goals. Be direct and concise, avoiding extraneous details and explanations. When communicating task or project goals, make sure you define key items, such as budget, deadlines, quality requirements, or important resources. Ensure your team members understand task and project goals by encouraging them to ask questions and clarify information. It will be up to you to continuously check in with your team to make sure they’re all moving towards their goals, staying on track, and completing quality work. Cross-functional teams may work in different departments, be in different physical locations, and have different leadership, but all team members work together with the project manager to support the current project. Your project may be competing against other priorities, so communicating clearly and often with your team—and vice versa—helps you identify any potential issues or concerns before they arise.   
Get team members with the right skills

Making sure you have team members with the correct skill sets for each of the project functions is critical. If you are building an airplane and you’ve got five engineers but no mechanics, you are missing a key element of your cross-functional team. As the project manager, you must help ensure that your team has the right people with the right skill sets needed for the project to succeed. Later in this program, we will discuss some tools you can use to help you identify the skill sets needed to accomplish your project tasks.  
Measure progress

Showing your team how much they have accomplished helps keep them motivated. Take the time to measure and communicate the project’s progress across the cross-functional team. This helps everyone see the full picture and recognize their impact on the project. You can measure progress in many ways, including meeting key milestones, completing project tasks, and meeting project goals on time and within budget. Regularly communicate with your team members to check on their progress. Ask them if they anticipate being finished on time. If not, ask how you can help them succeed. Keep track of the team’s progress throughout the project by documenting when tasks and goals are completed, and let your team members know if the project is on track or not. Make sure you communicate successes, delays, or issues, to the team so they know how the project is progressing. Keeping everyone informed is essential to the project’s success.  
Recognize efforts

Sometimes, when you work with cross-functional teams, there are certain skills that get recognized more than others. A mechanic could get accolades for coming up with the solution to a problem within the project, while the finance member who sourced the funding might be forgotten. As a project manager, it is your job to make sure that each member of your cross-functional team recognizes the value of their efforts each step of the way. You have learned the importance of building relationships with stakeholders, and building relationships with your cross-functional team members is just as important. Learning what makes your team members feel supported, giving and taking feedback, and being mindful of each individual's background, personal identifiers, and work style can help mediate some of the differences among team members. 

# Core skills  
Enabling decision-making,
communicating and escalating, flexibility,
and strong organizational skills. 

# Interpersonal skills 
communication, negotiation,
conflict mediation and understanding motivations are
all interpersonal skills that will
help you influence without authority. 

  
# Project lifecycle  
The main phases of a project are initiate the project,
make a plan, execute
and complete tasks, and finally, close the project. 

  
The project life cycle
Initiate the project

In this phase, ask questions to help set the foundation for the project, such as:

    Who are the stakeholders?
    What are the client’s or customer’s goals?
    What is the purpose and mission of the project?
    What are the measurable objectives for the team?
    What is the project trying to improve? 
    When does this project need to be completed? 
    What skills and resources will the project require? 
    What will the project cost? What are the benefits?

Make a plan

In this phase, make a plan to get your project from start to finish. 

    Create a detailed project plan. What are the major milestones? What tasks or deliverables make up each milestone?  
    Build out the schedule so you can properly manage the resources, budget, materials, and timeline. Here, you will create an itemized budget.

Execute the project

In this phase, put all of your hard work from the first two phases into action. 

    Monitor your project team as they complete project tasks. 
    Break down any barriers that would slow or stop the team from completing tasks. 
    Help keep the team aware of schedule and deliverable expectations.
    Address weaknesses in your process or examine places where your team may need additional training to meet the project’s goals.
    Adapt to changes in the project as they arise.

Close the project

In this phase, close out the project.

    Identify that your team has completed all of the requested outcomes. 
    Release your team so they can support other projects within the company.
    Take time with your team to celebrate your successes! 
    Pass off all remaining deliverables and get stakeholder approval.
    Document the lessons you and your team learned during the project.
    Reflect on ways to improve in the future.

  
# Project management methodology
A project management methodology is a set of guiding principles and
processes for owning a project through its life cycle.
Project management methodologies
help guide project managers throughout a project with steps to take,
tasks to complete, and principles for managing the project overall.

Lean

Lean methodology is often referred to as Lean Manufacturing because it originated in the manufacturing world. The main principle in Lean methodology is the removal of waste within an operation. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, only value is added at each phase of production.  

Today, the Lean Manufacturing methodology recognizes eight types of waste within an operation: defects, excess processing, overproduction, waiting, inventory, transportation, motion, and non-utilized talent. In the manufacturing industry, these types of waste are often attributed to issues such as: 

    Lack of proper documentation
    Lack of process standards
    Not understanding the customers’ needs
    Lack of effective communication
    Lack of process control
    Inefficient process design
    Failures of management

These same issues create waste in project management. 

Implement Lean project management when you want to use limited resources, reduce waste, and streamline processes to gain maximum benefits. 

You can achieve this by using the pillars of the Lean 5S quality tool. The term 5S refers to the five pillars that are required for good housekeeping: sort, set in order, shine, standardize, and sustain. Implementing the 5S method means cleaning up and organizing the workplace to achieve the smallest amount of wasted time and material. The 5S method includes these five steps: 

    Sort: Remove all items not needed for current production operations and leave only the bare essentials. 
    Set in order: Arrange needed items so that they are easy to use. Label items so that anyone can find them or put them away. 
    Shine: Keep everything in the correct place. Clean your workspace every day.
    Standardize: Perform the process in the same way every time. 
    Sustain: Make a habit of maintaining correct procedures and instill this discipline in your team.

Within the Lean methodology, 5S helps you boost performance. 

The final concept of Lean uses a Kanban scheduling system to manage production. The Kanban scheduling system, or Kanban board, is a visualization tool that enables you to optimize the flow of your team’s work. It gives the team a visual display to identify what needs to be done and when. The Kanban board uses cards that are moved from left to right to show progress and help your team coordinate the work. 
Kanban board, showing columns (to do, in progress, testing, and done) with sticky notes representing tasks of a project.

Kanban boards and 5S are core principles of the Lean methodology. They can help you successfully manage your project. Now let’s analyze the Six Sigma method and learn when is the best time to use it. 
Six Sigma

Six Sigma is a methodology used to reduce variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time. The term “Six Sigma” originates from statistics and generally means that items or processes should have 99.9996% quality.

The seven key principles of Six Sigma are:

    Always focus on the customer.
    Identify and understand how the work gets done. Understand how work really happens.
    Make your processes flow smoothly.
    Reduce waste and concentrate on value.
    Stop defects by removing variation.
    Involve and collaborate with your team.
    Approach improvement activity in a systematic way.

Use this methodology to find aspects of the product or process that are measurable like time, cost, or quantity. Then inspect that measurable item and reject any products that do not meet the Six Sigma standard. Any process that created unacceptable products has to be improved upon.  
  
  
## Popular project management approaches

Below is a brief recap of some of the project management approaches you’ve been introduced to so far:

Waterfall is a traditional methodology in which tasks and phases are completed in a linear, sequential manner, and each stage of the project must be completed before the next begins. The project manager is responsible for prioritizing and assigning tasks to team members. In Waterfall, the criteria used to measure quality is clearly defined at the beginning of the project.

Agile involves short phases of collaborative, iterative work with frequent testing and regularly-implemented improvements. Some phases and tasks happen at the same time as others. In Agile projects, teams share responsibility for managing their own work. Scrum and Kanban are examples of Agile frameworks, which are specific development approaches based on the Agile philosophy.

Scrum focuses on developing, delivering, and sustaining complex project and products through collaboration, accountability, and an iterative process. Like many Agile frameworks, work is often completed by smaller, cross-functional teams and divided into short “Sprints” with a set list of deliverables.

Kanban is both an approach and a tool that provides visual feedback about the status of the work in progress through the use of Kanban boards or charts. With Kanban, project managers use sticky notes or note cards on a physical or digital Kanban board to represent the team’s tasks with categories like “To do,” “In progress,” and “Done.”

Lean focuses on efficiency, applying core principles to maximize value and minimize waste. Lean’s principles state that you can do more with less by addressing dysfunctions that create waste.

Six Sigma involves reducing variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time. The Six Sigma method follows a process-improvement approach called DMAIC, which stands for define, measure, analyze, improve, and control.

Lean Six Sigma is a combination of Lean and Six Sigma approaches. It uses the 5S quality tool to eliminate eight areas of waste, save money, improve quality, and streamline processes. Lean Six Sigma uses Kanban boards to manage production and is ideal for solving complex or high-risk problems.
