# Project-Management
## Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to meet the project requirements and achieve the desired outcome.

Project managers usually follow a process that involves planning and organizing,
managing tasks, budgeting, controlling costs and other factors.
Everything they do helps make sure the project can be completed on time and
on budget.
In broad terms, a project manager also needs to make sure that
the project outcome is bringing value to the company.
